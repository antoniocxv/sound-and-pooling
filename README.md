# sound-and-pooling

In this project, we are showing different sound effects to a sample scene to see the behavior.
First of all, we are going to see the difference between the linear and logarithmic

Now, we are testing the audio mixer details. In this example, the video on the right has the echo has a delay of 5 seconds to check that the master prompt, starts once the audio is finishing, on the left video, with just 1ms the audio is almost at the same time.

The echo effect is a typical effect or an echo sound

With decay, the echo will disappear after more time since the sound has came back

In Unity we can make effects, like chorus, and we can configure with different options. In this case the sound has a little saturation and a chorus effect

We can configure the volume of a sound depending on the strength of the crash as we can see in the next video

The background music is very important in a game. In this case we have started it as it runs the game with a loop, but we can configure it in one item to control it.

In this case, we have configure a sound to simulate the steps of a man, we have looked for a sound and reproduce it when the block is moving.
